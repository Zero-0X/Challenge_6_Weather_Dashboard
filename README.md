## Usage

The Daily Planner is meant to be used to plan tasks for the average American workday (9-5). The current user will be able to save their daily plans to local storage anytime they need to, and will remain accessible to that particular user on that specific device. The planner is only meant for small amounts of data, as that is the limit for local storage. The current date and time is available in the header for user accessibility. As the day progresses, the user will be notified of past, present, and future time-blocks, in order to make planning more efficient and accurate.
